    <p>Green Marriot Island has long been a verdant gem in the southwest Pacific Ocean. It was discovered by Captain John Doe during a British Exploration mission in 1874. Prior to his arrival, the native population lived in harmony and would trade with each other using seashells as currency. Unfortunately the British visitors brought nasty diseases that killed off the entire native population, leaving nothing but seashells in their wake.</p>
    <p>The island was purchased in its entirety in 1974 but Marriot Hotels International. They cut down lots of trees and constructed quaint bungalows and lots of swimming pools. The island offers breathtaking views along the shores, and exciting jungle adventures in the interior.</p>
